Blokus DUO is a 2 player variant of the full Blokus Game, in which players take turns to place pieces of varying shapes and sizes onto a game board where the corners of your next piece must touch at least one of the corners of your previous pieces. Developed using Java with a full-featured Java Swing user interface. Testing was done using the JUnit testing framework.
