Developed an app, in a group of 2, that processes and extracts information about UBC courses and classrooms from ZIP and HTML files.
We further used API calls to retrieve GPS coordinates for the classrooms and implemented query validation using an EBNF key.
My partner and I also practiced Agile coding with regular stand-up meetings to ensure that continued progress was being made.
